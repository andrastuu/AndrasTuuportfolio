            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>The amount of astronomical data collected by observatories has exponentially increased in recent years. Classifying astronomical objects is crucial for processing this data. This thesis contributes to galaxy classification by enhancing accuracy and examining the relationships between data quality, model performance, and observational advancements.</p>
            <p>Datasets used include <strong>Galaxy10SDSS</strong>, <strong>Galaxy10DECals</strong>, and high-redshift samples of Galaxy10DECals. Preprocessing techniques like Supervised and Unsupervised Wiener Deconvolution, Chan-Vese segmentation, and Non-Local Means denoising were applied. Multi-class classification was performed with <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> and <strong>Vision Transformers (ViTs)</strong>. Generally, preprocessing improved model performance. ViT models achieved the best performance in most cases, though CNNs outperformed ViTs on high-redshift samples. Non-Local Means Denoising and Supervised Wiener Deconvolution were top preprocessing methods, with Supervised Wiener Deconvolution proving most efficient in terms of computation.</p>

            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Datasets:</strong> Galaxy10SDSS, Galaxy10DECals, and high-redshift samples.</li>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing Techniques:</strong> Supervised and Unsupervised Wiener Deconvolution, Chan-Vese segmentation, Non-Local Means Denoising.</li>
                <li><strong>Models Used:</strong> Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).</li>
                <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> ViT models generally provided the best performance, except for high-redshift samples where CNNs performed better. Non-Local Means Denoising and Supervised Wiener Deconvolution were the best preprocessing techniques, with Supervised Wiener Deconvolution being the most computationally efficient.</li>
            </ul>
